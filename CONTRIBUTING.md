## ü§ù Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a Code of Conduct that we expect all contributors to follow:

- **Be respectful** and inclusive in your language and actions
- **Be collaborative** and help others learn and grow
- **Be constructive** when giving feedback
- **Focus on what's best** for the community and the project

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git
- Basic knowledge of Python and game development concepts
- Familiarity with ECS (Entity Component System) architecture is helpful

### Areas Where We Need Help

- üêõ **Bug fixes** - Help us squash those pesky bugs
- ‚ú® **New features** - Implement items from our roadmap
- üìö **Documentation** - Improve guides, API docs, and examples
- üß™ **Testing** - Write tests and improve coverage
- üé® **Examples** - Create games and demos using Arepy
- üîß **Performance** - Optimize the ECS engine
- üéÆ **Game bundles** - Add more built-in components and systems

## üíª Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/arepy.git
cd arepy

# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Scr44gr/arepy.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Install uv (if you don't have it)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies with testing extras
uv sync --extra testing

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Verify Installation

```bash
# Run tests to make sure everything works
uv run pytest

# Run a simple example
uv run python examples/bunnymark.py
```

## üîß Making Changes

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a new branch for your feature
git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
# or for bug fixes:
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Development Guidelines

#### **ECS Architecture**
- Keep components as **pure data** containers
- Put logic in **systems**, not components
- Use **queries** to filter entities efficiently
- Follow the **single responsibility principle**

#### **Code Organization**
```
arepy/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ecs/             # Core ECS implementation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components.py    # Component base classes
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ entities.py      # Entity management
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ registry.py      # ECS registry
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ query/          # Query system
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ systems.py      # System pipeline
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bundle/          # Built-in components and systems
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/     # Common game components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ systems/        # Common game systems
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ engine/          # Engine integration (Raylib, etc.)
```

#### **Component Example**
```python
from arepy.ecs import Component

class Velocity(Component):
    """Component representing velocity in 2D space."""
    
    def __init__(self, x: float = 0.0, y: float = 0.0):
        super().__init__()
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
```

#### **System Example**
```python
from arepy.ecs import Query, Entity, With

def movement_system(query: Query[Entity, With[Transform, Velocity]]):
    """System that applies velocity to transform positions."""
    for entity in query.get_entities():
        transform = entity.get_component(Transform)
        velocity = entity.get_component(Velocity)
        
        transform.position.x += velocity.x
        transform.position.y += velocity.y
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=arepy --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_registry.py -v

# Run tests for specific functionality
uv run pytest -k "test_query" -v
```

### Writing Tests

- **Write tests for all new features**
- **Add tests for bug fixes** to prevent regressions
- **Use descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested
- **Follow pytest conventions**

#### Test Example
```python
import pytest
from arepy.ecs import Registry, Entity
from arepy.bundle.components import Transform

def test_entity_component_operations():
    """Test adding, getting, and removing components from entities."""
    registry = Registry()
    entity = registry.create_entity()
    transform = Transform(x=10.0, y=20.0)
    
    # Add component
    entity.add_component(transform)
    assert entity.has_component(Transform)
    
    # Get component
    retrieved = entity.get_component(Transform)
    assert retrieved.x == 10.0
    assert retrieved.y == 20.0
    
    # Remove component
    entity.remove_component(Transform)
    assert not entity.has_component(Transform)
```

### Coverage Requirements

- **New code should have at least 80% test coverage**
- **Critical ECS functionality should have 90%+ coverage**
- **Bug fixes must include tests**

## üé® Code Style

### Python Style Guide

We follow **PEP 8** with some project-specific conventions:

```bash
# Format code with black (if you have it installed)
black arepy/ tests/

# Sort imports with isort (if you have it installed)
isort arepy/ tests/
```

### Conventions

- **Use type hints** for all function parameters and return values
- **Write docstrings** for all public classes and functions
- **Use descriptive variable names**
- **Keep functions small and focused**

#### Docstring Example
```python
def create_entity(self) -> Entity:
    """Create a new entity in the registry.
    
    Returns:
        Entity: A new entity with a unique ID.
        
    Example:
        >>> registry = Registry()
        >>> entity = registry.create_entity()
        >>> print(entity.get_id())
        1
    """
```
